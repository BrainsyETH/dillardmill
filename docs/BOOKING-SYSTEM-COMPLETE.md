---

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Square Setup

1. **Create Square Account**
   - Go to https://developer.squareup.com/
   - Create application
   - Get credentials (see BOOKING-SETUP.md for details)

2. **Add to .env.local**:
```bash
SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_sandbox_token
SQUARE_LOCATION_ID=your_location_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID=your_app_id
```

### 2. Resend Email Setup

1. **Create Account**: https://resend.com (free tier: 3000 emails/month)
2. **Get API Key**
3. **Add to .env.local**:
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key
ADMIN_EMAIL=pinevalley@dillardmill.com
```

### 3. Database Setup

Run database migration:
```bash
node -e "require('./src/lib/db/setup').setupDatabase()"
```

This creates:
- `bookings` table
- `external_bookings` table
- `booking_inquiries` table

### 4. Calendar Sync Setup

#### Get iCal URLs:

**Airbnb:**
1. Go to your listing
2. Settings → Availability → Calendar sync
3. Copy the "Export Calendar" URL

**Hipcamp:**
1. Dashboard → Calendar
2. Export iCal feed
3. Copy URL

**VRBO:**
1. Calendar → Settings
2. Export iCal
3. Copy URL

#### Add to Sanity:

1. Open `/studio`
2. Go to each Rental Unit
3. Scroll to "Calendar Sync" section
4. Paste iCal URLs

#### Set Up Automatic Syncing:

**Option A: Vercel Cron** (Recommended)
1. Add to `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "crons": [{
    "path": "/api/calendar/sync",
    "schedule": "0 */6 * * *"  // Every 6 hours
  }]
}
```

**Option B: External Cron Service**
Use service like cron-job.org to hit:
```
POST https://dillardmill.com/api/calendar/sync
Authorization: Bearer your_cron_secret
```

Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
CRON_SECRET=your_random_secret_token
```

#### Manual Sync:
Visit: `https://dillardmill.com/api/calendar/sync`

## 🎯 How It Works

### Booking Flow

1. **Guest selects dates** on unit page
   - DatePicker shows availability in real-time
   - Checks internal + external bookings

2. **Guest enters information**
   - Name, email, phone
   - Number of guests
   - Special requests

3. **Guest pays with credit card**
   - Square Web SDK loads payment form
   - Card details never touch your server (PCI compliant)
   - Payment processed instantly

4. **Booking confirmed**
   - Record created in `bookings` table
   - Confirmation email sent to guest
   - Admin notification sent
   - Redirect to confirmation page with code

### Calendar Sync Flow

1. **Cron job triggers** `/api/calendar/sync`
2. **Fetches iCal feeds** from Airbnb, Hipcamp, VRBO
3. **Parses dates** from iCal format
4. **Stores in `external_bookings`** table
5. **Availability checks** now include these dates
